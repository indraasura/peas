# Kanban Implementation for Areas and PODs

This document outlines the implementation of Trello-style kanban boards for areas and PODs management.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates

**File: `database-schema-update.sql`**

- Added `status` field to areas table (backlog/planned)
- Added `one_pager_url` field to areas table for file uploads
- Created `area_comments` table for area discussions
- Updated RLS policies and permissions

### 2. TypeScript Types Updates

**File: `src/lib/supabase.ts`**

- Updated `Area` interface to include `status`, `one_pager_url`, and `comments`
- Added `AreaComment` interface for area comments

### 3. Data Layer Updates

**File: `src/lib/data.ts`**

- Updated `getAreas()` to fetch comments and decision quorum
- Added area comment management functions:
  - `getAreaComments()`
  - `createAreaComment()`
  - `updateAreaComment()`
  - `deleteAreaComment()`
- Added `getPlannedAreas()` for POD creation dropdown

### 4. Reusable Kanban Component

**File: `src/components/KanbanBoard.tsx`**

- Created a reusable kanban board component
- Supports drag and drop functionality using `react-beautiful-dnd`
- Configurable columns, items, and actions
- Trello-like UI with Material-UI components

### 5. Areas Kanban Board

**File: `src/app/dashboard/areas/page.tsx`**

- Replaced table view with kanban board
- Two columns: Backlog and Planned
- Area cards display:
  - Name and description
  - Impact values (Revenue, Business, Efforts, User Impact)
  - Associated PODs
  - One-pager status
  - Comments count
- Validation logic for moving areas from backlog to planned:
  - Requires one-pager upload
  - Requires at least one POD assignment
- Comments system for each area card
- Drag and drop functionality between columns

### 6. PODs Kanban Board

**File: `src/app/dashboard/pods/page.tsx`**

- Replaced table view with kanban board
- Five columns based on POD status:
  - Backlog
  - Planning
  - In Development
  - Testing
  - Released
- POD cards display:
  - Name and description
  - Associated area
  - Leader information
  - Member details with bandwidth
  - Start/end dates
  - Review notes count
- Detailed POD view with:
  - Full member list with roles
  - Review meeting notes
  - Status and timeline information
- Drag and drop functionality between status columns

### 7. Package Dependencies

**File: `package.json`**

- Added `react-beautiful-dnd` for drag and drop functionality
- Added `@types/react-beautiful-dnd` for TypeScript support

## Features Implemented

### Areas Management
- ✅ Create areas in 'backlog' state
- ✅ Move areas from backlog to planned (with validation)
- ✅ One-pager requirement for planned areas

- ✅ Comments system for areas
- ✅ Impact values display
- ✅ Associated PODs display

### PODs Management
- ✅ Status-based kanban columns
- ✅ Member details with bandwidth and roles
- ✅ Leader identification
- ✅ Review meeting notes integration
- ✅ Area association
- ✅ Timeline display

### Validation Rules
- ✅ Areas cannot move to planned without one-pager
- ✅ Areas cannot move to planned without POD assignment
- ✅ Only planned areas appear in POD creation dropdown

### UI/UX
- ✅ Trello-like design and interactions
- ✅ Drag and drop functionality
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Material-UI components
- ✅ Color-coded status indicators
- ✅ Card-based layout

## Usage Instructions

### For Areas:
1. Create new areas - they start in 'backlog' status
2. Upload one-pager document (implementation needed)
3. Assign PODs to the area
4. Drag area card from 'Backlog' to 'Planned' column
5. Add comments to area cards for discussions

### For PODs:
1. Create new PODs (only planned areas available in dropdown)
2. Assign members with bandwidth percentages
3. Set leader for the POD
4. Drag POD cards between status columns as work progresses
5. View detailed POD information including review notes

## Database Migration

To apply the database changes:

1. Run the SQL commands in `database-schema-update.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor
2. Install the new dependencies: `npm install`
3. The application will automatically use the new kanban interface

## Testing

The implementation has been designed to work with existing data. All existing areas and PODs will:
- Areas will default to 'backlog' status
- PODs will maintain their current status
- No data loss during migration

## Future Enhancements

1. File upload functionality for one-pagers
2. Real-time collaboration features
3. Advanced filtering and search
4. Bulk operations
5. Custom status columns
6. Integration with external tools
7. Analytics and reporting dashboard
