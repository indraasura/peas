# Feature Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… **One-Pager View/Download Functionality**

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/dashboard/areas/page.tsx` - Added view/download button logic

### 2. âœ… **Area Comments Functionality**
**Problem**: Comments failing to be added in areas
**Root Cause**: Using placeholder user ID instead of actual authenticated user
**Solution Applied**:
- Imported `getCurrentUser` from auth library
- Updated `handleAddComment` to get actual user ID from auth context
- Added proper error handling for unauthenticated users

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/dashboard/areas/page.tsx` - Fixed user authentication for comments

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/dashboard/pods/page.tsx` - Fixed user authentication for review notes

### 4. âœ… **Dashboard Capacity Labels Update**
**Problem**: 
- "Required capacity" should be renamed to "Assigned capacity"
- Total capacity column should be removed from team-wise bandwidth allocation

**Solution Applied**:
- Renamed all instances of "Required capacity" to "Assigned capacity"
- Removed total capacity column from the table
- Updated interface `TeamBandwidthData` to remove `totalCapacity` field
- Updated calculations to use `assignedCapacity` instead of `requiredCapacity`
- Adjusted summary cards layout (now 2 cards instead of 3)
- Updated color and status calculation functions

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Complete dashboard capacity labels overhaul

## Technical Details

### Authentication Integration
Both comments and review notes now properly integrate with the authentication system:
```typescript
const currentUser = await getCurrentUser()
if (!currentUser) {
  setError('Please log in to add comments/notes')
  return
}
```

### One-Pager UI Enhancement
- Upload button: Shows upload icon for new files, green color when file exists
- View button: Separate download icon that opens file in new tab
- Tooltips: Clear indication of button functionality

### Dashboard Layout Changes
- **Before**: 3 summary cards (Total Team Capacity, Required Capacity, Available Capacity)
- **After**: 2 summary cards (Assigned Capacity, Available Capacity)
- **Table**: Removed "Total Available Capacity" column
- **Calculations**: Updated to use assigned vs available capacity

## Expected Results

After these fixes:

- âœ… Area comments work with proper authentication
- âœ… POD review notes work with proper authentication
- âœ… Dashboard shows "Assigned Capacity" instead of "Required Capacity"
